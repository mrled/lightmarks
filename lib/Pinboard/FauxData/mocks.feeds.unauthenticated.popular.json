    "d": "How Apple made its new M1 chip, the latest MacBooks – and used its past to decide its future • The Independent",
    "n": "Andrew Griffin: <blockquote><p>it’s still the case that fans repeatedly speculated that Apple was going to do something more profound to the Mac: turn it into something like the iPad, for instance, or use the transition to radically alter how its laptops work. Apple has repeatedly insisted that it thinks the laptop form factor is valuable and distinct from touchscreens like the iPad, but people haven’t always believed them.\r\n\r\nThis has led to ideas including the theory that Apple had redesigned its new macOS to make way for touch screen Macs. The Big Sur aesthetic borrows from the iPhone and iPad – buttons are bigger, with more space, which numerous commentators pointed out would make them perfect for manipulating with your fingers – but not because of some secret plan to change the way the Mac works, [Apple software chief Craig] Federighi says.\r\n\r\n“I gotta tell you when we released Big Sur, and these articles started coming out saying, ‘Oh my God, look, Apple is preparing for touch’. I was thinking like, ‘Whoa, why?’\r\n\r\n“We had designed and evolved the look for macOS in a way that felt most comfortable and natural to us, not remotely considering something about touch.\r\n\r\n“We're living with iPads, we're living with phones, our own sense of the aesthetic – the sort of openness and airiness of the interface – the fact that these devices have large retina displays now. All of these things led us to the design for the Mac, that felt to us most comfortable, actually in no way related to touch.\r\n\r\n“I've never felt more comfortable moving across our family of devices as a user, which I do hundreds of times a day than I do now, moving between iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS Big Sur. They all just feel of a family – there's just less cognitive load to the switching process.\r\n\r\n“It's just they all feel like the natural instantiation of the experience for that device. And that's what you're seeing not some signaling of a future change in input methods.”</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat seems pretty specific that Apple's not going to make the Mac touchable. But what does that mean for iOS apps running on it? And you know too that when they decide that they <em>are</em> going to make it touch-based - well, the time was just right. A couple of years off at least though.",
