### ‚¨úÔ∏è Fix network error

Since the last time I had it working -- sometime in the past week? --
I can't use the app in production mode any more.

I try to make a request and I get an error in the React console in the terminal after about 75 seconds:
`Type Error: network request failed`.

This is on iOS.
Apparently people are seeing this on Android only in recent React Native versions,
e.g. <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/29608>.

Tried upgrading React Native etc, no change in behavior.

Going to try getting the Android build working to compare it with...
... nope, getting the same error.
This must not be a platform specific problem, but something else.
Try investigating the "Should be using hook for smart request balancer queue" task?

Here's a bunch of logs

#### Maybe I should use React Query?

The overview really sells it <https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/overview>. I have like, ALL of those problems.

Biggest question: can I rate limit its requests?
Looks like the answer is YES!
<https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/guides/default-query-function>

I can define a 'default query function', which in the example uses `axios.get`.
`smart-request-balancer` also uses Axios... I bet I can glue these things together.

I think that would also work for fetching real/fake data.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Replace `console.error` with `console.warn`

Apparently React Native doesn't play nice with `console.error`?
See <https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/react-native>.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Should be using hook for smart request balancer queue

Realized just now that I define the queue in the module, but I don't think it'll work like that.
Need to use a hook or something.
Not sure of the right abstractions for this...
maybe I create the queue in usePinboard() and pass it in to `new Pinboard()` when I instantiate?

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Use some secret gesture to bring up DebugInfo

It's nice to have, but it would be nicer if it weren't a tab.
Maybe a 4 finger swipe or some other gesture that's unlikely to be accidental would be better.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Add simple filters for the feeds

- Do not show Twitter / show only Twitter
- Do/don't display tags, user notes, user name
- Show only bookmarks with notes / do not show bookmarks with notes

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Toggle mock/production mode in app

Maybe even with a visible reminder of what mode I'm in on all screens?

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Build an in-app web view

This is exceptionally lazy, but: see the devnotes I added in ebd6be97e3dd990e9eafbdcae947a71882697ce2.
They contain a link or two and some thoughts.
(And I reverted that commit right after.)

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Discover tab: add screen for filtering bookmarks in public feed

- Filter by username
- Filter by up to three tags
- Search within those results (not sure how to make clear in UI)

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Profile tab: add features

- See all/public/private/unread/tagged/untagged bookmarks
- Expose all of the rest of the API
- See network

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Finish typing the Pinboard library

- Type return values
- Use a generic `.getJson<ReturnType>()` -like function to set `ReturnType` so I know what to expect the raw API results to be. See the stuff I just did in the PinboardApi for examples.
- Use `OneToThreeStrings` or `YesOrNo` as appropriate
- While I'm there, make sure all HTTP calls (API, Feeds, anything) are going in to a named queue.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Cache results of API calls

- Cache results of API calls
- Always show when data was last updated
- If the data is new enough, don't bother contacting API at all
- What's new enough? Probably depends on the API call.
- If data is too old, show cached data and note that it's loading newer data in the background
- If data is nonexistent, just note that it's loading

Should we let users force request new data from API?

- Maybe a pull to refresh mechanism
- Brute force: delete local caches button in settings

One idea: a `Local cache` control panel that pops up or over or something

- Anything that holes cached data has a panel like this
- "Force refresh now" button
- Displays info on when item was last cached etc

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Do I need a UI kit?

- NativeBase seems like a decent default. It has a lot of components. (Maybe some are paid only?)
- UI Kitten might look pretty good, but has way fewer components.
- react-native-paper is Material Design, so I don't think it'll look right on iOS
- Lots of other ones, but these seem to be the biggest?

I have to say, discovering this stuff is hard when you're starting from absolute scratch like me.
I literally only even found these because I was searching all of github for how to set a React Navigation stack nav top bar... and the results were all from people using paper or UI Kitten or similar.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Work perfectly offline

This is part of caching results and perfect data sync.

Maybe with this? <https://github.com/rgommezz/react-native-offline>

### ‚¨úÔ∏è Cancel outstanding tasks on unmounting a component

If I request data from the network, and then navigate away before it returns and updates the view,
I need to cancel that task or else I will get an error on the console like this:

```
[Fri Nov 20 2020 22:24:52.770]  ERROR    Warning: Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
```

### ‚¨úÔ∏è üî± Implement tag management

- See all untagged bookmarks
- Rename tags
- Group tags with the same prefix (like my `code:typescript`, `code:python`, etc convention)
- Show tags with fewer than X or more than Y bookmarks, as a way to surface too generic or too broad tags

### ‚¨úÔ∏è üî± Add a share sheet

The share sheet is the most important feature of the app tbh.
It needs to be perfect.
And it cannot lose data, ever.

- Extremely fast, single view. No animations shifting over to the right to edit the description or add tags.
- Never lose data. If it can't post to the server, must save operation and try again later.

#### Share sheet steps

- Using <https://github.com/meedan/react-native-share-menu>
- When adding `ShareViewController.swift` from the `node_modules` directory, it asked me if I wanted to create a `LightmarksShare-Bridging-Headers.h`... I said NO here.
- For the new share extension target you create, it has you update your Podfile.
  It tells you to manually link the packages there... I think this is different from the normal target,
  which autolinks them... I think manually linking them gives you more control so your extension doesn't get too big.
  (There is a RAM limit for share extensions.)
- I chose `Lightmarks://` for the URL scheme unique to my app
  - The docs are fucking silent about this, but it's clear from the example that you enter this twice in different formats
  - In your app's `Info.plist`, you enter it without the `://`. For intance, if your scheme is like `ExampleApp://`, you would enter `ExampleApp` only.
  - In the share extension's `Info.plist`, you enter it WITH the `://`, like `ExampleApp://`.
- Got an error about ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES bring overridden, fixed via
  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40191140/cocoapods-1-1-1-target-overrides-the-always-embed-swift-standard-libraries>
- There's a separate page "Custom iOS Share View
  <https://github.com/meedan/react-native-share-menu/blob/master/SHARE_EXTENSION_VIEW.md>
  ... if you don't do this, you get a default modal from iOS that has Cancel and Post buttons, a preview of the page you're sharing, and an editable text box that contains the HTML title of the page by default.
- I did also make a custom share extension view
  - Without this, you use an OS default share sheet thing, which I haven't seen since like iOS 5 or something, everyone customizes this now
  - The share extension view is a separate entrypoint in your app, from Node's perspective
  - Will commit it with example code from `react-native-share-menu` and add a real bookmark add screen in another commit

Update: ok, I did get the AddBookmark screen on the share sheet.
However, it doesn't seeme to actually submit anything.
My guess is that the share sheet process is getting killed and the submission is cancelled.

#### Actually saving the result and sending the data

- I should use NSUserData to save data from the extension into the app
  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24118918/sharing-data-between-an-ios-8-share-extension-and-main-app>
- I could use that + to save the shared bookmark to some kind of queue, which the app can read from
- I also want to start a background process to handle updloads
  - Looks like there is an iOS function for `NSURLSessionConfiguration` called `backgroundSessionConfigurationWithIdentifier`
  - ex: <https://github.com/EkoLabs/react-native-background-downloader>
  - ex: <https://github.com/Vydia/react-native-background-upload>
  - Swift code: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52567979/background-upload-with-share-extension>
- App will need to support "Finite-length tasks"
  - <https://www.raywenderlich.com/5817-background-modes-tutorial-getting-started#toc-anchor-008>
- I _think_ what I want is to have it dismiss immediately, without a "Saved!" notification like Pinner has...
  ... but it has to be 100% trustworthy
- Some options for data sharing: <https://dmtopolog.com/ios-app-extensions-data-sharing/>
- Based on that list, I wonder if database sharing (using the filesystem) is a better way than `NSURLSessionConfiguration`.
  Because: this way the queue is the only thing submitting HTTP requests,
  and the share extension is only saving to the queue and then asking the queue to start work
  (which the queue may do immediately, or may wait for earlier actions to do first).
- That makes me think of another thing: I could use the priority of `smart-request-balancer`
  to distinguish between background API calls and user-initiated API calls.
- Some details on `NSUserDefaults`: <http://dscoder.com/defaults.html>

### Show a list of unresolved actions in the UI

If there are actions that haven't been completed yet, like adding a new bookmark,
show that the action is still in the queue and what its state is.
A way of convincing users that the app is trustworthy by allowing them to verify it.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è üî± Perfect data sync

NEVER LOSE DATA

- If I try to save a link and Pinboard is not responding (down/rate limited/no network), save link for later
- There is no real sync here, because Pinboard API doesn't show me list of events
- That should be ok for saving bookmarks, as saving it again doesn't hurt anything
- For situations where both the client and the server have edited bookmark metadata, there is sadly possibility to lose data. I think these situations will be rare, and I can do the best I can by trying not to delete data. Also, generally, missing description is not as bad as missing whole bookmark.

### ‚¨úÔ∏è üî± Excellent PDF support

- Pull titles from PDF metadata
- Can I make the app doing anything useful while a PDF is loading? Is there a way to asynchronously load?
- Some kind of sane tag suggestion, even if it's just local

### ‚¨úÔ∏è üî± On-device read-later

- Add a reader mode
- Automatically strip garbage from webpages
- Option to pull archive version from Pinboard
- Keep reading progress perfectly - never lose your place, even if the app is force quit or the device reboots, goddamit.

## üåô üåô üåô üåô üåô Longer, less finished ideas

AKA "moonshots"

These aren't to do items, they're less defined than that. Just thoughts.

### üåô Fancy filters for the feeds

- Ignore politics / Show only politics
- Show only long or only short articles

### üåô Parse Pinboard HTML for more features

- The /popular/wikipedia page
- Also fandom and Japanese popular pages
- User pages? (Maybe I can just get this wth feeds)
- Perhaps most importantly, on-site SEARCH. I can search the title/url/desc/tags of the local copy of my own bookmarks, but will need Pinboard's help to search the full text of my bookmarks or any public bookmarks!

Looks like e.g. Pushpin is just getting all it can of the recent/popular posts and filtering by wikipedia for its wikipedia screen.
Not sure what it's doing for its fandom screen -- maybe it can tell if a user has fandom enabled, and is just showing posts from those users?

### üåô An "On this day" feature, like Day One has

This is a cool feature from Day One; would be pretty cool to have in bookmarks too, I think.

## ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ Completed log, finished tasks

### Icons

Using some icons for tab navigation. Started here: <https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-navigation>

That required setting up react-native-vector-icons: <https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons>

Using `react-native link` didn't work, and I couldn't figure out CocoaPods in 30 seconds.
I installed using the manual instructions.
There was a stumbling block there too --
I had to go into Xcode and remove the icons from getting copied at build time, per
<https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/issues/1074>.
Otherwise I got a ton of errors like 'Multiple commands produce /long/path/whatever.ttf'.

To fix this, I blindly followed instructions without thinking too hard:

> Find a solution, simply remove duplicate reference fonts in "Copy Bundle Resources" NOT in "[CP] Copy Pods Resources"

and

> For anyone else who didn't know this, Copy Bundle Resources can be found under the Build Phases` tab in the target in your project

I have not yet done this for Android!! So whenever I get around to testing Android, I guess it will be a pain in the ass and I hope I remember this note.

### ‚úÖ üî± Implement a Discover tab

- View for the popular feed
- View for the recent feed
- Navigation with back button
- Show list of bookmarks

The list of bookmarks even looks halfway decent, fuck yeah

### ‚úÖ When tapping on links, highlight the link

- Important for links to u:USERNAME and to actual bookmarked links
- Especially useful for screen recordings

Done. This was actually already working for regular text with `onPress` events.
I added a `<Pressable>` for a set of two `<Text>` components I wanted to be part of a single link.

### ‚úÖ üî± Implement a Profile tab

- Show recent posts
- Requires understanding separate API results from feeds vs API

### ‚úÖ üî± Implement a global API rate limit

Pinboard will rate limit you, and it won't even follow its own docs and use a rate limit message.

- Start by following guidelines in API docs
- Add a back-off mechanism, where it doubles the wait time
- How to manage too many tasks filling it up?

Used `smart-request-balancer` for this, we'll see how it goes.
No plan yet for dealing with too many tasks filling it up...
I expect I'll need to get more sophisticated with time.
Biggest weakness currently is lack of cached data --
loading same data over and over again will result in a queue that's full of reloading the same stuff.
Added task for caching old results.

- <https://github.com/energizer91/smart-request-balancer>
- <https://hackernoon.com/limiting-your-api-requests-the-right-way-9608b661a0ce>

### ‚úÖÔ∏è Get an icon

At least a prelim one

- Got `collections_bookmark` from Material Design icons
- Used <http://easyappicon.com/> to convert it to Android and iOS icons
- Add to iOS: Open xcworkspace (or xcproj if you don't have a workspace), go to project name -> Image Assets -> AppIcon, add the right sizes one by one
- Add to Android: not sure yet, Android build is broken and I'm over it

### ‚úÖÔ∏è Rename to Lightmarks

- Rename all the stuff in Xcode that I could
- Move folders to new names
- `rg -i betterpins` and replace with `Lightmarks` everywhere, even in Xcode files
- Don't forget to `find -name '*betterpins*'` too
- And `rg` will not find text matches in the `.gitignore` file, AND will ignore items listed in `.gitignore`,
  so look at that file separately.

Also during this

- Change the bundle identifier to be `com.micarhl.me` rather than `org.reactjs.native.example` --
  `rg -i org.reactjs.native.example` and change from there
- Remove everything related to tvOS, first in Xcode and then with `rg` and `rm`

How to do this for Android? No idea, that's for later I guess.

### ‚úÖÔ∏è Get Android build working

I rarely look at this, and it wasn't building.
Now it is.

- Had to move to Gradle 6.3 to deal with changes in React Native package since I initialized my project
- Had to add react-native-config package for some reason, <https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config/issues/228>
- Follow react-native-vector-icons instructions for Android

#### Changing the name to Lightmarks in the Android project

- Set package name to `com.micahrl.lightmarks`, lower case. Apparently Java convention is that packages ought to have lower case, and my linter caught it -- although I seem to be importing a bunch of things with case, idk.
- All I had to do was `rg` files containing the old name, and `find` files/directories with the old name in their filenames, and rebuild, and that was it
