# ðŸŒ™ ðŸŒ™ ðŸŒ™ ðŸŒ™ ðŸŒ™ Longer, less finished ideas

AKA "moonshots"

These aren't to do items, they're less defined than that. Just thoughts.

## Tasks

### ðŸŒ™ Fancy filters for the feeds

- Ignore politics / Show only politics
- Show only long or only short articles

### ðŸŒ™ Parse Pinboard HTML for more features

- The /popular/wikipedia page
- Also fandom and Japanese popular pages
- User pages? (Maybe I can just get this wth feeds)
- Perhaps most importantly, on-site SEARCH. I can search the title/url/desc/tags of the local copy of my own bookmarks, but will need Pinboard's help to search the full text of my bookmarks or any public bookmarks!

Looks like e.g. Pushpin is just getting all it can of the recent/popular posts and filtering by wikipedia for its wikipedia screen.
Not sure what it's doing for its fandom screen -- maybe it can tell if a user has fandom enabled, and is just showing posts from those users?

### ðŸŒ™ An "On this day" feature, like Day One has

This is a cool feature from Day One; would be pretty cool to have in bookmarks too, I think.
